From a CSV, perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis utilizing SQL.

To model the data, I used QuickDBD to sketch the Entity-Relationship Diagram.

To engineer the data, I created a table schema for each of the provided CSV files and imported each CSV into its corresponding SQL table.

Finally, I ran 8 requested queries to find specific data.
